# COTI API 

The objective of this project is to retrieve data from COTI's website, store it and then make it available for queries trough an API.

The project was divided in 2 main parts: the scraper and the API. 
- For the scarper several libraries have been used, however the two most important ones where [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/bs4/) and requests. 
Since COTI’s website was JavaScript rendered and the project required not only data from the Front-End but also data not available there, POST and GET protocols of the website have been emulated applying reverse engineering to get the expected response. 
The data was then stored in a MongoDB repository by using [pymongo](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/pymongo/) driver. 

- For the API, [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) was used for its development. 
Further information on how to run the project can be found below. 

## GENERAL INSTRUNCTIONS

The project contains 2 main files: 
-	scraper.py
-	API.py

Before opening those files, please open your virtual environment and run the following:
```bash
# Install the requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The transactions’ information is already uploaded to MongoDB and ready to be used trough the API. However, if you want to reload the information just uncomment the last line in the scarper.py file. 

To use the api please run the following in the virtual environemnt's terminal:
```bash
# Start the service:
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

The API must be accessible now at http://localhost:8000 in your browser. 
To see the API's documentation use the following command: http://localhost:8000/docs
You will come up with this:

The API can run 3 consultations:
-	By hash: It tries to emulate COTI’s function to retrieve information by inserting a known hash. To run this please use: http://localhost:8000/{hash}. Replace “hash” with the code you are interested to look for. 
-	By date: It retrieves information from a given day. To run this use: http://localhost:8000/{day}/{month}/{year}. Please use the format “%d/%m/%Y”
-	Between dates: Similar to the previous one but this query retrieves information  between dates (inclusive) http://localhost:8000/{day_1}/{month_1}/{year_1}/{day_2}/{month_2}/{year_2}. Please use the same date format as the previous one.
